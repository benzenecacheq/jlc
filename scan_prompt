Please scan this handwritten or typewritten lumber and hardware materials list and extract each item with its quantity and description

IMPORTANT PATTERN RECOGNITION:
- If a line is missing material specifications (like "4X8 16'" instead of "4X8 PT 16'"), look at the PREVIOUS non-empty line to see what material was specified and carry forward the material specification from the most recent line that had one
  For example: if you see "4X8 DF#2 20'" followed by "4X8 16'", the second item should be interpreted as "4X8 DF#2 16'"

- The most common type of lumber is douglas fir, abbreviated DF, so if you see two letters handwritten and they look like they could be DF, they probably are

- if you see a vertical line on the document, possibly with an arrowhead pointing downward, it means that you should carry forward the value above that line onto the items traversed by that line

- These are common board lengths that are specified in inches rather than feet.  Look for these: 12-7/8, 14-7/16, 22-7/16, 80-3/4, 92-1/4, 104-1/4, 116-1/4

- There are specific sizes for lams (Versalam, parallam, microlam, lvl, psl, glulam and other laminated lumber) so look for these as well, especially when looking at items that appear to be lams:
   1-3/4x11-7/7, 1-3/4x14, 1-3/4x16, 1-3/4x7-1/4, 1-3/4x9-1/2,
   3-1/2x11-7/8, 3-1/2x9-1/2, 3-1/2x14, 3-1/2x16,
   5-1/4x11-7/8, 5-1/4x9-1/2, 5-1/4x14, 5-1/4x16, 5-1/4x18,
   7x11-7/8, 7x14, 7x16, 7x18

Examples of good matches:
- Handwritten "2x12 20'" → Description: "2X12  20" (matches database format)
- Handwritten "4x4 12 PT" → Description: "4X4  12  PT" (matches database style)
- Handwritten "#8 screws" → Description: "#8 SCREWS" (matches database style)

Format your response as a JSON array where each item has:
{
    "quantity": "the number/amount",
    "description": "item description formatted to match database style",
    "original_text": "the original handwritten text as you read it",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low - how confident you are in the match"
}
