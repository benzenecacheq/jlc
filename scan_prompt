Please scan this handwritten or typewritten lumber/materials list and extract each item with its quantity and description.

IMPORTANT PATTERN RECOGNITION:
- If a line is missing material specifications (like "4X8 16'" instead of "4X8 PT 16'"), look at the PREVIOUS non-empty line to see what material was specified
- Carry forward the material specification from the most recent line that had one
- For example: if you see "4X8 DFH2 20'" followed by "4X8 16'", the second item should be interpreted as "4X8 DFH2 16'"
- If an item has a horizontal line through it, it should be ignored
- The most common type of lumber is douglas fir, abbreviated DF, so if you see two letters handwritten and they look like they could be DF, they probably are

- Handwritten "4x4 12 PT" → Description: "4X4  12  PT" (matches database style)
- Handwritten "#8 screws" → Description: "#8 SCREWS" (matches database style)

Format your response as a JSON array where each item has:
{
    "quantity": "the number/amount",
    "description": "item description formatted to match database style",
    "original_text": "the original handwritten text as you read it",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low - how confident you are in the match"
}

Focus on making descriptions that will match items in the provided database.
